# deploying-docker-on-asw
Deploy docker on aws and try out small applications.


- I created an EC2 instance on aws
- then I connected to this instance with putty
- afterwards installed docker on this instance. Here I made use of the following [aws instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html){:target="_blank"} 
- `hello world`
